# 2048
Console version of the '2048' game written in Python

To start the game, execute the [`main.py`](https://github.com/Aleksandr-Nvk/2048/blob/main/src/main.py) file in your terminal window.

**IMPORTANT**: make sure that you have enough space in your terminal window, since some terminals don't support scrolling, and content of the game might be chopped off or corrupted.
